## 💪 Challenges I faced

- Show & open dialog of the right birthday buddy.
- Calculating the right hijri dates with the `hijri` gem as it shows previous date.
- Calculating next gregorian birthday & hijri birthday to set reminders.
- Using the Solid Queue for background jobs. ([Issue](https://github.com/rails/solid_queue/issues/253))
- Sending birthday email reminders to the user exactly on midnight regardless of which time zones they are from.
- Designing UI. (theme, font, navigation flow, responsive layout, etc).
